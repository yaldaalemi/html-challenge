## Background

This project involves a comprehensive web scraping and data analysis exercise to collect information about Mars, including Mars news articles, and Mars weather data. The aim is to strengthen core skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Overview

### Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- Utilized automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to visit the [Mars News website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and scrape news articles.
- Extracted titles and preview text, storing the data in Python dictionaries.
- Compiled all dictionaries into a Python list.
- Printed the list in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Optionally, exported the data to a JSON file.

### Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Used automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to visit the [Mars Temperature Data Site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) and scrape temperature data.
- Assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Examined data types and cast/converted them as needed.
- Analyzed the dataset using Pandas to answer key questions:
   - Determined the number of months on Mars.
   - Calculated Martian days of data.
   - Identified the coldest and warmest months on Mars.
   - Found months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars.
   - Estimated the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.
- Visualized results through bar charts.
- Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Usage

- Explore the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the web scraping and data analysis process for Mars news articles and weather data.
- Interact with the data, visualize insights, and understand the characteristics of Mars.

## Note

This project enhances skills in web scraping, data analysis, and visualization while providing valuable insights into Mars.
